## Welcome to the team!

We're excited to have you on board. The purpose of this project is to get you familiar with our application and toolset.

Please spend some time reading through our docs and be sure to ask questions as they arise.

Next, you will start writing some code!

### Onboarding project

You will work through building a component using React, TypeScript and Tailwind, working with mock data from Sitecore, writing tests, and setting up your component in Storybook.

To begin, please create a new branch off of this `onboarding` branch:

```
git checkout onboarding
git checkout -b onboarding-yourname
```

#### The Component

You will be creating a NewsBanner component.

* View the component [design](https://app.abstract.com/projects/7d33aa49-f1f0-47eb-971d-893d6457bcbc/branches/9556131a-d820-4925-8e56-968513c820b5/commits/latest/files/56AED96A-C786-42FD-8B75-CFA17F1BE644/layers/2CFCCB94-B674-49E3-B0CD-E73E9BEEAB81?collectionId=e0eaf804-c52c-4f76-9ae9-c8643bd687e3\&collectionLayerId=26c85763-39d5-411c-991b-ed946c19bf50) in abstract
* Ask questions about the design if you have any
* Go to `./src/components/NewsBanner`
* Start building out the component, reference the `./docs` to understand the files to create and how to use them (composition, data, index, stories, test, types)
* Be sure to make commits to your branch
* When done, push all commits to remote and open a pull request
